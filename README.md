## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Othello (also known as Reversi) board game. The game is designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing black or white discs on the board, flipping the opponent's discs by surrounding them in a straight line. The game continues until neither player can make a valid move, and the player with the most discs on the board wins.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The primary goal of this project is to create a playable version of Othello with a functional UI and game logic. The focus is on:

- Rendering a dynamic game board with valid moves highlighted.
- Implementing the core game mechanics (player turns, disc placement, and flipping).
- Allowing users to restart the game, track scores, and determine the winner.
- Developing a simple algorithm to enable solo gameplay against the computer.
- Enhancing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building a complete interactive game.
